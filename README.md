**Digit Classifier Project**
Overview
The Digit Classifier project is a machine learning project that uses a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. This project aims to build a model that can accurately predict the digit (0-9) from an image of a handwritten digit.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset.
Model Building: Creating and compiling a neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.
Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the test set.
Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment
Keras & TensorFlow: Libraries for building and training neural networks
MNIST Dataset: Dataset of handwritten digits

**Getting Started**
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-classifier.git
cd digit-classifier

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Run the Notebook:

Open the digit_classifier.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run all the cells to train and test the digit classifier model.

**Usage**
Load and preprocess the data: The notebook includes steps to load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it for training.
Build and compile the model: The notebook demonstrates how to build a neural network using Keras and compile it with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Train the model: Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and visualize the results.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new handwritten digit images.
