**Digit Classifier Project**

Overview
The Digit Classifier project is a machine learning project that uses a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. This project aims to build a model that can accurately predict the digit (0-9) from an image of a handwritten digit.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset.
Model Building: Creating and compiling a neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.
Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the test set.
Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment
Keras & TensorFlow: Libraries for building and training neural networks
MNIST Dataset: Dataset of handwritten digits

**Usage**
Load and preprocess the data: The notebook includes steps to load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it for training.
Build and compile the model: The notebook demonstrates how to build a neural network using Keras and compile it with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Train the model: Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and visualize the results.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new handwritten digit images.
